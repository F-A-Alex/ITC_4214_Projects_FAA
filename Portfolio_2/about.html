        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <p>
            <strong>Pints & Pages</strong> was founded in 2018 by two lifelong friends and passionate readers, <i>Paige Turner</i> and <i>Justin Case</i>. 
            What began as a cozy weekend reading ritual quickly blossomed into a welcoming book club for fellow literature lovers.

        <p>
            Our goal is simple: create a warm, inclusive space where stories come alive and friendships grow page by page. We believe every book opens a door, and every member brings something special to the conversation.
