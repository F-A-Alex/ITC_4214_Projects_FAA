                    <h3>Summary:</h3>
                    <p> 
                        The Fellowship of the Ring by J.R.R. Tolkien is the first volume of The Lord of the Rings trilogy. 
                        It follows Frodo Baggins, a young hobbit who inherits the One Ring, a powerful and dangerous artifact created by the Dark Lord Sauron. 
                        To prevent Sauron from reclaiming it and conquering Middle-earth, Frodo sets out on a perilous journey to destroy the Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        He is joined by a group called the Fellowship of the Ring: Gandalf the wizard, Aragorn the ranger, Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Boromir of Gondor, and fellow hobbits Sam, Merry, and Pippin. 
                        As they travel through forests, mountains, and ancient ruins, they face threats from orcs, betrayal, and the growing power of the Ring. 
                        The Fellowship is eventually broken, and Frodo has to continue the quest with only Sam by his side.
